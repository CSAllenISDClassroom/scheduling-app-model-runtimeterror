# Getting General State of Schedule 
## Futionality
This feature is designed to help students to build schedules without class conflicts (prerequisites, empty classes, availability at certain times of the day).
## Design
The plan is to get all the classes and their respective information (periods offered, prerequisites, and other info), and create an algorithm or function that checks the classes for these conflicts.
## QA
This will hopefully be mostly automated. May need an override option incase something breaks.
